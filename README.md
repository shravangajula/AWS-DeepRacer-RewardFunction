# AWS DeepRacer Project

## Project Status

We have made the difficult decision of ceasing active development on this repo as of Dec 2023.

## Overview

This project involves the development of an AWS DeepRacer, utilizing various AWS services to enhance model training, improve deployment efficiency, and refine the reward function for optimal learning outcomes. Our efforts significantly impacted the overall project success, leading to high-performance results and notable achievements in the racing competition (Track - 2022 re:Invent Championship).

## Features

- **Model Training**: Leveraged AWS services such as SageMaker for efficient and scalable model training.
- **Deployment**: Streamlined deployment processes using AWS tools.
- **Reward Function**: Developed and refined reward functions to improve learning outcomes and racing performance.

## Installation

To install the AWS DeepRacer Compatible Reward Function package, use:

```sh
pip install deepracer-compat-reward-function

Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 are supported on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
